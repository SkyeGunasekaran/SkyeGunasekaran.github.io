I am a Computer Science major & undergraduate researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am focused on the clinical translation of artificial intelligence to create transparent and interpretable AI systems that can help clinicians and have a tangible impact on healthcare. My research has led me to develop a time-series framework called Future Guided Learning (FGL), which is inspired by predictive coding theory. 

As a South Indian trans woman, I am committed to breaking down systemic barriers for marginalized communities. I co-created a new course, CMPM 118-03, at UCSC to provide a clear pathway for over 150 students to gain hands-on experience in machine learning. My future goal is to build a unified framework that integrates patient-specific data alongside an accurate and interpretable forecasting backbone to provide clinicians with accurate and reliable predictions.
