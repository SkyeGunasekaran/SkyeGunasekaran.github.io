I am an undergraduate researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, focused on the clinical translation of artificial intelligence. My research is driven by a desire for tangible impact: to create transparent and interpretable AI systems that augment the expertise of clinicians and positively affect the greatest number of people. I believe the next AI breakthrough will come from a deeper understanding of domain-specific knowledge, guided by the interdisciplinary spirit of AI, neuroscience, and psychology.

My research is focused on developing multimodal and interpretable AI to solve pressing challenges in healthcare. My previous work established a framework called Future Guided Learning (FGL), which uses principles from neuroscience to enhance time-series forecasting for tasks like seizure prediction. To make these models clinically viable, I've integrated methods for uncertainty quantification using Bayesian Neural Networks and incorporated unique biological profiles by developing novel graph-based representations of genetic data. Moving forward, I aim to build a unified framework that integrates a patient's dynamic data, like EEGs, with their static genomic profile to provide clinicians with accurate, reliable, and understandable predictions.

I believe that building a strong research community requires a commitment to inclusivity. At UCSC, I identified a systemic lack of clear pathways for undergraduates to gain research experience and spearheaded the creation of a new course, CMPM 118, to provide that structured opportunity. In my role, I designed an accessible curriculum and personally mentored over 150 students, providing them with hands-on machine learning experience. As a South Indian trans woman, I am personally driven to break down systemic barriers for marginalized communities, and this work has helped broaden the pipeline of diverse talent entering research at UCSC and beyond.
