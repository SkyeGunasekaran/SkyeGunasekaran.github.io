To address the lack of a clear pathway for undergraduates to gain research experience at UCSC, I spearheaded the creation and design of CMPM 118: Collaborative Research Experiences In Engineering. I developed a comprehensive curriculum with lectures, assignments, and a group-based final project to prepare new students for a rigorous research environment. Through this initiative, I have personally mentored and supervised over 150 students, providing them with hands-on experience in machine learning. The success of this program is demonstrated by my students, who have co-authored an accepted manuscript at the Baylearn conference and presented their work at UCSC science fairs.
